# IEEE-VST

A VST (Virtual Studio Technology) is a plug-in software interface that either synthesizes or affects audio within a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).

The intention of this project is to create a VST effect plugin for implementation on the Knights Open Circuit Podcast vocal chain. It also may serve as a production aid for music created under the IEEEDM (IEEElectronic Dance Music) initiative and an item of interest for the DAW workshop.

This project will be programmed using C++, primarily through the Visual Studio IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

There will be three teams as follows:
1. User Interface Team (#ui-ux) - configure faders, knobs, scopes, plugin settings and appearance.
3. Signal Algorithms Team (#dsp) - develop digital audio data processing techniques.
4. C++ Development Team (#cpp)- work with JUCE framework to create VST3 format.
