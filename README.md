# IEEE-VST

A VST (Virtual Studio Technology) is a plug-in software interface that either synthesizes or affects audio within a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).

The intention of this project is to create a VST effect plugin for implementation on the Knights Open Circuit Podcast vocal chain. It also may serve as a production aid for music created under the IEEEDM (IEEElectronic Dance Music) initiative and an item of interest for the DAW workshop.

This project will be programmed using C++, primarily through the Visual Studio IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

There will be three teams as follows:
- User Interface Team
- Signal Algorithms Team
- C++ Development Team
